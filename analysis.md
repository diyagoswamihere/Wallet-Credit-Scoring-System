Analysis of Wallet Scores

The histogram shows the distribution of wallet scores across 10 bins (0-100, 100-200, ..., 900-1000). 
Most wallets scored between 600-700, with a mean of 634.77 and a standard deviation of 49.29, indicating scores are tightly clustered. 
No wallets scored below 520 or above 777.26, likely due to limited borrowing or liquidation activity in the dataset.

Wallet Behavior:-

1. Low Score Wallets (0-400):

  Number of wallets: 0
  Average liquidation count: N/A
  Average time span: N/A
  Average unique assets: N/A
Observation: No wallets scored below 400, suggesting the dataset lacks significant risky behavior like liquidations or very short activity periods.

2. High Score Wallets (600-1000):

  Number of wallets: 3059
  Average liquidation count: 0.00
  Average time span: 23.07 days
  Average unique assets: 2.51
Observation: These wallets have no liquidations, moderate activity periods (~23 days), and use ~2-3 assets on average, indicating reliable but not highly diverse usage.

Insights:-

The absence of low-score wallets and the high number of wallets above 600 suggest the dataset primarily includes deposits and redemptions, 
with no liquidations or borrowing activity. This leads to similar scores (~600-700) driven by time and asset diversity bonuses. 
High-score wallets show stable, consistent DeFi participation, but the short average time span (23 days) limits higher scores.
